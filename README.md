# spherex-helper-scripts

In order to run the scripts against a real network you need to configure the hardhat.config.js (https://hardhat.org/tutorial/deploying-to-a-live-network) file with the netwroks you want and create .env file with your PRIVATE_KEY (see .env.example)


## configureProtecteContracts.js
Configure the operator, engine and protected sigs for each contract in the contracts' data file.
In order to run the script, change the four settings at the top of the scripts:
```
const SPHEREX_OPERATOR_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001337";
const SPHEREX_ENGINE_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001337";
const CONTRACTS_DATA_PATH = "";
const LOCAL_FORK = true;
```

The contracts_data file should be provided by the spherex team.

The script expect to run inside hardhat environment:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/configureProtectedContracts.js 
```

## deployAndConfigureEngine.js
Deploy an engine, sets the allowed senders and allowed patterns (does not turn on protection!).
In order to run set the three settings at the top of the sciprt:
```
const ALLOWED_SENDER_PATH = "";
const ALLOWED_PATTWERNS_PATH = "";
const LOCAL_FORK = true;
```
The allowed senders and patterns should be provided by the spherex team.

The script expect to run inside hardhat environment:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAndConfigureEngine.js 
```
